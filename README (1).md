## Overview

This is a full-stack Blog Application that allows users to create, edit, and publish blog posts with categorized tags. The project is deployed on GitHub and is built using the following technologies:


## Tech Stack

### Frontend:

React.js - A popular JavaScript library for building fast and interactive user interfaces.

TypeScript - A strongly typed superset of JavaScript that helps improve code quality and maintainability.

Vite - A modern frontend build tool that provides a fast development environment with hot module replacement.

### Backend:

Spring Boot - A powerful framework for building Java-based web applications, simplifying backend development with its convention-over-configuration approach.

Hibernate - A Java-based ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) framework that handles database interactions efficiently.

H2 Database - A lightweight, in-memory database used for quick and easy development and testing.

Spring Security - A security framework that provides authentication and authorization capabilities to secure the application.
## Features

1. User Authentication (Login) - Secure login functionality to ensure only authorized users can access the system.

2. Create Posts - Users can compose and add new blog posts to share their content.

3. Edit Posts - Modify existing posts with updated content as needed.
